Prototype Working Notes
------------------------
Welp, what do we need here.

<Graphics Output>
A module that handles all console.write statements which display the game's output. Contains generic methods of displaying game data, which exists in the Graphics Manager.

<Graphics Manager>
A module that contains the meat and bones of the graphics layer - logic and data required to have a working GUI. Graphics output is either called by this or uses this for variable data to output

<Input Controller>
TODO: We'll probably need one to catch input from user and relay it to the Main Controller, but I don't see why the Main Controller can't just do it. Will revise later. Its mostly here to split stuff up into neat chunks.

<Main Controller>
Brain of the program. All program logic goes through here. Main() will probably have this and start the whole game with a Start().

-----------------------------
Main Controller Subcomponents
-----------------------------
NOTE: The Builders exist to ensure that their respective data structures are made verified and usable. The Managers exist to use/change the game board by using their respective 

<Turn Controller>
Controls turn/round logic. Contains all the actual data, which it loans out as reference. 
- TODO: Should I start considering thread safety? 

<Overlay Builder>
Creates Overlay objects to attach to Actions/Moves. 
- Action overlay generation will need parameters like horizontal/vertical growth, generic shape (diamond, square, tunnel, etc.) provided from its parent Action object
- Action overlays can also be custom made from a file - its more tedious but it allows for unique shapes 
- Movement overlay generation will need a ref to a model of the game map, the location of the unit being moved, and Move object attributes like maximum move range, vertical movement limit, etc.

<Action Builder>
Creates Action objects to attach to Units.
- This has to be created from an external file, there's really no two ways about it.
- All units should have a standard Attack action (with their equipped weapon) generated with a hardcoded method

<Move Builder>
Creates Move objects to attach to Units.
- Like Actions, moves have to be created from a file.
- The exception is that all units should have a standard Move (walking) so that should have a hardcoded method

<Map Builder>
Creates a Map object made of Tiles from an external file. 

<Unit Builder>
Creates Units using an external file. Puts together Actions, Moves and Units into a complete Unit. It'll probably include parts like Weapons and Passives in the future.

<Action Grid Builder>
Creates a selection grid for action targeting using an Overlay + Map + origin Tile.

<Move Grid Builder>
Creates a selection grid for movement purposes using a Move + Map + origin Tile.

<Action Manager>
Contains the methods for realizing Actions in the game. Could be a huge method, although using a class and breaking it down into sub methods would be cleaner. 

<Move Manager>
Contains the methods for realizing Moves in the game. 

------------------------
Miscellaneous (aka I'm too sick to figure out where this belongs)
------------------------

<Menu Builder>
Takes data, returns menus. Needs access to all data, feeds output to graphics layer for display. Output isn't graphics, but rather something the graphics layer can interpret. A custom data structure for each different menu, perhaps. 
- By the above this should belong in the Main Controller
- An alternative is to have this belong in the Graphics Manager, so we can skip the need for custom structures for menus; this seems like the saner choice

<Custom Move Queue>
I need a better name for this. Basically what this does is enable custom pathing. If someone wants his unit to take a long way around to avoid being spotted or traps or w/e the reason, he can opt to construct his own path.
- This will need a Queue of Move, each with their own Move Grid
- Each time the custom path is extended, a new Move is made and added to the queue using the values of the previous Move
	> For example, a Unit moves 2 squares N then decides to turn E and move another 2 squares.
	> The first move would be using the original Move; the second would have a new move with 2 horizontal move range deducted
NOTE: This is just an idea - not to be implemented until basic stuff are done.

------------------------
Data Structures
------------------------

<Unit>
Other than the basic unit stats (hp, mp, etc.) it should also have
- A list for Actions and another for Moves
- A ref to its owner (Player) would be useful
- Its current location (Tile)

<Tile>
Basic unit of a Map. Should have a x/y/z coord, and a reference to its occupant Unit, if any.

<Action Grid>
Formerly Selection Grid. An Action Grid contains a list of tiles and a list of people possibly affected by the Action. Its used by the game for targeting purposes. It is made through an Overlay

<Move Grid>
Formerly Selection Grid. A Move Grid contains a list of tiles, along with the distance/cost of movement/shortest path of each tile from the origin, all calculated from a Move.

<Action>
Should have an Overlay, a target (Unit) and some RPGish stats for display and Overlay generation, and a Selection Grid. 
- TODO: Actually, I'm not too sure about needing a target; I imagine that should be used immediately by the Action Manager upon target selection.

<Move>
Mostly the same as Action. A Selection Grid, target (again, unsure) and probably some stats for display + overlay generation. Moves don't have Overlays since they don't have a fixed template/shape.

<Map>
A collection of Tiles. Will have a 3d array of Tiles (other structures up for debate), a tile count and x/y/z size for calculations and display.

<Player>
Owner of Units. Contains a list<Units> owned, a unique id, a priority token (int) that allows for tiebreaks during initiative checks. 

<Overlay>
An array of special objects which represents a template to be overlaid on the map. Its purpose is to aid in creating an Action Grid.
