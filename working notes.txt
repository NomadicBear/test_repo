Prototype Working Notes
------------------------
Welp, what do we need here.

<Graphics Output>
A module that handles all console.write statements which display the game's output. Contains generic methods of displaying game data, which exists in the Graphics Manager.

<Graphics Manager>
A module that contains the meat and bones of the graphics layer - logic and data required to have a working GUI. Graphics output is either called by this or uses this for variable data to output

<Input Controller>
TODO: We'll probably need one to catch input from user and relay it to the Main Controller, but I don't see why the Main Controller can't just do it. Will revise later. Its mostly here to split stuff up into neat chunks.

<Main Controller>
Brain of the program. All program logic goes through here. Main() will probably have this and start the whole game with a Start().

-----------------------------
Main Controller Subcomponents
-----------------------------

<Turn Controller>
Controls turn/round logic. Contains all the actual data, which it loans out as reference. 
- TODO: Should I start considering thread safety? 

<Overlay Generator>
Creates Overlay objects to attach to Actions/Moves. 
- Action overlay generation will need parameters like horizontal/vertical growth, generic shape (diamond, square, tunnel, etc.) provided from its parent Action object
- Action overlays can also be custom made from a file - its more tedious but it allows for unique shapes 
- Movement overlay generation will need a ref to a model of the game map, the location of the unit being moved, and Move object attributes like maximum move range, vertical movement limit, etc.

<Action Generator>
Creates Action objects to attach to Units.
- This has to be created from an external file, there's really no two ways about it.
- All units should have a standard Attack action (with their equipped weapon) generated with a hardcoded method

<Move Generator>
Creates Move objects to attach to Units.
- Like Actions, moves have to be created from a file.
- The exception is that all units should have a standard Move (walking) so that should have a hardcoded method
s
<Map Generator>
Creates a Map object made of Tiles from an external file. Could have a hardcoded method for the prototype.

<Unit Generator>
Creates Units using an external file. Really at the end of the day nothing should be hardcoded in, with the exception of enum-based Type Identifiers, since those will need custom logic.

<Action Manager>
Contains the methods for realizing Actions in the game. Could be a huge method, although using a class and breaking it down into sub methods would be cleaner. 

<Move Manager>
Contains the methods for realizing Moves in the game. 

<Unit Manager>
Used for assembling units. Puts together Actions, Moves and Units into a complete Unit. It'll probably include parts like Weapons and Passives in the future.

------------------------
Data Structures
------------------------

<Unit>
Other than the basic unit stats (hp, mp, etc.) it should also have
- A list for Actions and another for Moves
- A ref to its owner (Player) would be useful
- Its current location (Tile)

<Tile>
Basic unit of a Map. Should have a x/y/z coord, and a reference to its occupant Unit, if any.

<Selection Grid>
An array of Tiles that represents a subset of tiles on the map. This subset can be used for highlighting and tile selection purposes. TODO: In my head this is just a list<Tile> with a fancy name. Decide if I want to keep this as a class - for now, it helps sort out my thoughts

<Action>
Should have an Overlay, a target (Unit) and some RPGish stats for display and Overlay generation, and a Selection Grid. 
- TODO: Actually, I'm not too sure about needing a target; I imagine that should be used immediately by the Action Manager upon target selection.

<Move>
Mostly the same as Action. A Selection Grid, target (again, unsure) and probably some stats for display + overlay generation. Moves don't have Overlays since they don't have a fixed template/shape.

<Map>
A collection of Tiles. Will have a 3d array of Tiles (other structures up for debate), a tile count and x/y/z size for calculations and display.

<Player>
Owner of Units. Contains a list<Units> owned, a unique id, a priority token (int) that allows for tiebreaks during initiative checks. 

<Overlay>
An array of special objects which represents a template to be overlaid on the map. Its purpose is to aid in creating a Selection Grid.
